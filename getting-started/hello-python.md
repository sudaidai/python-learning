# Hello, Python!

In this guide, we'll write your very first Python program. This program will print the classic "Hello, World!" message to the console. This is often the first step when learning a new programming language.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should have Python installed on your system. If you haven't installed Python yet, please refer to the [Anaconda Installation Guide](../installation.md) or the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for installation instructions.

## Writing Your Python Program

1. Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice. You can use text editors like Notepad (on Windows), Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or any other code editor you prefer.

2. Create a new Python file and save it with a `.py` extension. For example, you can name it `hello.py`.

3. In your Python file, type the following code:

   ```python
   # This is a simple Python program.
   # It prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console.

   print("Hello, World!")
