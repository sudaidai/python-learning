# Variables and Data Types in Python

In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. Data in Python comes in various types, and it's important to understand these data types when working with variables. This guide will cover some common data types and how to use them.

## Numeric Data Types

### Integer (int)

Integers are whole numbers without a decimal point. Examples:

```python
x = 5
y = -10
```

### Float (float)
Floats are numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form. Examples:
```python
pi = 3.14159
e = 2.71828
```

### Text Data Type

#### String (str)
Strings are used to represent text data. They can be enclosed in single or double quotes. Examples:
```python
name = "Alice"
message = 'Hello, World!'
```

### Boolean Data Type

#### Boolean (bool)
Boolean data types represent binary values, either True or False. Examples:
```python
is_student = True
is_working = False
```

### Lists
Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different data types. Example:
```python
vtuber = ["Gwar gura", "Flare", "Kiara"]
```

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. Example:
```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```
